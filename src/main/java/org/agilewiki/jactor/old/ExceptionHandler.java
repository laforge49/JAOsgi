 * To assign an exception handler, call the setExceptionHandler method in the
 * constructor of an actor.

 * <p>
 * If an exception occurs when processing a request, and no exception handler
 * has been assigned, the exception is passed to the exception handler of
 * the actor which sent the request, recursively.
