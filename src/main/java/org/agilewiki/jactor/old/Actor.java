/**
 * <p>
 * Actors are objects which send messages to each other and which process only one message at a time. Messages are
 * either requests or responses. When an actor sends a request to another actor, it expects to receive a single
 * response unless an exception has been thrown.
 * </p><p>
 * When an actor sends a message it provides a callback to handle the response. The callback may be invoked either
 * immediately or later. After sending a message, an actor may send additional messages or return control, at which
 * point it may receive other requests or pending responses.
 * </p><p>
 * An actor typically interleaves the processing of multiple requests. To process a request to completion, an actor may
 * need to send requests to other actors (in series or parallel) and process the responses to those requests. Actors
 * process requests and responses as they are received whenever the actor is not busy processing a message. There is no
 * way to block incoming requests. Actors are thread-safe, but message processing is not atomic.
 * </p><p>
 * Some actors are asynchronous. Requests sent to an asynchronous actor are processed on a different thread. Actors which
 * perform heavy computation or which do I/O should be asynchronous. Asynchronous actors play an important role in
 * vertical scalability, allowing a program to make effective use of multiple hardware threads. But care should be used,
 * as asynchronous message passing tends to be slow.
